# Tanzanian_Water_Wells

## Overview
This project uses data on various water wells in Tanzania and attempts to build a predictive model that can discern between operational and non-operational water wells. The data contains information on each water well such as longitude, latitude, funder, management, pump type, and much more. The Tanzanian government can use this analysis and predictive model in order to decide where to allocate funding for water wells.

## Business Understanding
Tanzania is a developing country with a population of over 57 million people. This country struggles to provide its large population with clean water. However, there are many water wells throughout the country. The Tanzanian government needs a way to predict if these water wells are operational or non-operational. Due to the nature of this problem, predicting a water well is operational when in reality it is not, is more costly than predicting a water well is non-operational when in reality it is.
